 Realistic Procedural Generation of Urban Environments Using Blender and Python

## Project Overview
### **Introduction**
Urban design traditionally demands vast manual effort in modelling and detailing cityscapes. However, with the rise of procedural generation techniques, cities can now be algorithmically generated with architectural plausibility, aesthetic realism, and efficient scalability. This case study explores how Blender and Python scripting can be used to generate realistic urban environments, blending automation with creative control.

---

## **Objectives**
- Design a procedural pipeline that generates modular, realistic urban layouts.
- Utilize Blender's API and scripting capabilities to dynamically create roads, buildings, and environments.
- Optimize the system for customization, randomness, and potential real-world data integration.

### **Procedural Methodology**
#### üß± Layout Generation
- Grid-based city templates and road networks using Python algorithms.
- Organic sprawl using noise functions (Perlin, Simplex).

#### üè¢ Building Modelling
- Parameterised facades, varied floor counts, roof types, and spacing.
- Use of instancing and modifiers for efficiency.

#### üõ£Ô∏è Roads & Infrastructure
- Dynamic generation with curves, sidewalks, and intersections.
- Integration of street objects (lamps, signs, bus stops).

#### üå≥ Environmental Details
- Procedural placement of trees, benches, vehicles, and street clutter.
- Use of seeds for reproducibility and variance.

## Research Questions
- How can procedural generation techniques simulate urban planning constraints and aesthetics?
- What methods best balance randomness and realism in procedural urban layouts?
- How effective is Python scripting in automating scalable geometry creation in Blender?
- What are the trade-offs between Python scripting and Geometry Nodes for building complex cityscapes?

## Research Components

These form the conceptual and experimental backbone of the project:

- Literature Review: Explore papers on procedural modelling, e.g. shape grammars, L-systems in architecture.
- Comparative Analysis: Evaluate Python-based generation vs. Geometry Nodes for performance and flexibility.
- Pattern Studies: Analyse real-world city grid styles (Manhattan, Tokyo, Paris) for parametric modelling inspiration.
- User Feedback (Optional): If targeting educational tools or simulations, gather feedback on realism and usability.

## Practical Components

Where research meets implementation:

- Python Script Modules:
 | `layout_generator.py`: Generates roads and city block templates.
 | `building_generator.py`: Applies customizable parameters to build facades, windows, roof types.
 | `detail_placer.py`: Scatters benches, vegetation, vehicles based on zone logic.
 
- Geometry Node Systems:
 | Modular building prototypes using array and subdivision nodes.
 | Street props distributed along curve data.
 | Performance Optimization:
 | Use of instancing, collections, and viewport rendering settings for complex scenes.
